Firebase: Firebase is used for user authentication and storing the user-specific data like saved destinations, reviews , and ratings. It also used for real-time updates.
OpenWeatherMap API: This API provides the information for selected destinations. It shows current weather and forecast so that user can plan their trip accordingly.
